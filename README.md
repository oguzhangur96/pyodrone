# pyODrone
This will be an objective focused multi agent drone reinforcement learning library.

## TODO:
- [ ] Write initial empty environment skeleton, upload code to **test.pypi** 
- [ ] Create a single agent, gridworld-like drone environment
- [ ] Add single agent algorithm support to gridworld-like drone environment
- [ ] Add multi agent support to gridworld-like drone environment
- [ ] Add multi agent algorithm support to gridworld-like drone environment
- [ ] Integrate to 3D environments such as PEDRA or AirSim
